Notes 
<OL id="n">
<li> Hello from @droidEdit @android! </li>
<pre> Beautiful integration of all needed tools:
color picker (hash only though), browser preview (save first), nightmode.
Ed: Reader-only mode still inputs. Only difference seems to be a visibe caret.
ed: ll: No spellcheck. 
No autocomplete of brackets or tags. Yip, good. 
Bracket matching is singled out when both are highlighted after closing brace is inputted. (Or navigated to).
#hotkeys for saving. Manually set successfully for switching to browser: [ctrl+shift+b].
Gonna take [ctrl+shift+s] from "saving to remote"(?) to "null".//
</pre>

<li>#HTML #CSS:</li>  <OL>
<li>12% not enough for [hr] height?//
<pre>Sadly, nope. Removing the width attribute (100%), results are the same.
Percentage units are just not for this tag then.
Changed to px units. 22 --> 122. --> 222

Stretched element to ends of page. (horizontal negatives).
ll: Removed plain white border.
Added back 20% to [margin-bottom]. but.
Now there's big gap on bottom. Um.
Makes not much sense but switched the difference to [-top]. Yeah, nope.
Tried 20%. Smaller. Consider the same size (px unit) of HR itself?
Didn't work. Plain. Wasn't +/- either.
Ah well, 5% works. No +/-.
</pre>
<li>Hello simplistic Perfection.
<li> Interesting #CSS or #HTML dom-styling observation: Trying to style a LI with an opening OL tag within it, styles the entire list it opens. Hm.//
<pre>Slightly unrelated but good stuff.
TY(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2144010/is-there-a-way-to-extend-background-color-of-unordered-list-items-to-go-behind-b)
[list-style-position:inside] to extend #CSS [background-color] attributes to bullet points.//
</pre>
<li>List items of [#n] are a little indented. 
<pre>Tried inputting [margin:0] into both selectors: [#n>li](of previous styles) 
and [OL>OL]. No go. #bah. ed: Cannot be bothered with negatives again.. 
Maybe.
ll: Tried selectors [OL,LI] and individually. Tried seeing if there was a difference between OL tags on their own line in the plain text. Nope.
Fine negatives. [margin-right:-2%] didn't have much effect though. 
12% was too much. ll: -6% is a bit wonky. Setting selectors back to [#n>li]..
Final statement:<xmp>#n>li,li {margin-left:-7%;}</xmp>
</pre>
<LI> XMP elements are (great but) inserting in some white space before input?
<pre> Trialed a few [white-space] attributes. With or without TY(http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_white-space.asp). 
Result: Not using any of it. Just related DOM-element back to single line. (It was inside a pre, therefore the/an attribute was already being applied).
Verdict: Back to simple [margin:0] afterall..
